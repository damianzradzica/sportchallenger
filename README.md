# sportchallenger
The simple sport facilities booking system.

Application was crearted on the base of Django framework. 
It uses Python mainly, but also some scripts take advantage of Javascript possibilities.
Project includes:
- views to create users and sport facilities,
- calendar which let user book a facility for a day,
- view with user history, which shows current and previous reservations,
- function of dynamic search of sport facilities (made in Javascript).

In the project I have used also a REST (JSON) to tranfer data to the calendar concerning already booked dates
for a given sport facility.
